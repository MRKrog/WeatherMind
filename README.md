# WeatherMind

## Overview:

WeatherMind is my take on the Apple IOS weather app. This weather app gets real time weather of your location. As well you can search locations all over the world for their current weather. When searching for weather you are able to see the forecast by the hour and the week. Also you can find more details about the current weather in your location. I built this app with the intent on converting this into a react native application.
